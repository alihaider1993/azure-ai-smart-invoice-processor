## Project Overview

This solution automates invoice processing using Azure AI services and a multi-agent workflow.

The system can extract invoice data from PDFs/images, process multiple invoices in one batch, validate invoice information, detect duplicates, convert multiple currencies to GBP, classify expenses, detect fraud, generate executive reports, run approval workflow decisions, store results in Azure Cosmos DB, and provide analytics dashboards.

## Azure Services Used

| Service | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Azure OpenAI GPT-4o | Classification, reasoning, reporting |
| Azure Document Intelligence | Invoice OCR and extraction |
| Azure Cosmos DB | Invoice storage, duplicate detection, vendor analytics |
| Azure AI Foundry | AI project and deployment management |
| Managed Identity | Secure authentication without API keys |
| Streamlit | Web application frontend |

---

## Multi-Agent Architecture

### Agent 1 — Invoice Extractor
Extracts structured invoice data from PDFs and images using Azure Document Intelligence and GPT-4o Vision.

### Agent 2 — Validator
Validates required fields, invoice dates, amount consistency, duplicate checks, and GBP currency conversion.

### Agent 3 — Classifier
Classifies invoices into expense categories and stores vendor analytics in Azure Cosmos DB.

### Agent 4 — Fraud Detector
Scores fraud risk and flags suspicious invoice patterns.

### Agent 5 — Reporter
Creates executive summaries, finance action items, and report exports.

### Agent 6 — Approval Workflow
Applies business rules for approval, rejection, manager review, and finance review.

| Condition | Decision |
|---|---|
| Duplicate invoice | Rejected |
| Fraud score >= 70 | Finance approval |
| GBP amount > 1000 | Manager approval |
| Validation errors | Rejected |
| Low-risk valid invoice | Auto-approved |

---

## Security

The project uses enterprise-style Azure authentication:

- `DefaultAzureCredential`
- Azure Managed Identity
- Azure RBAC
- No API keys in source code
